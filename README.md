<img src="./readme/title2.svg"/>

A platform that collaborates project engineers process in a professional and easier way, engaging owner and manager with project process, real-time communication between engineers about issues and updates and their several other features.

Communication between engineer can increase the work functionality and troubleshooting 
With my project features engineers can create their own virtual world and collaborate. Sharing Files, comment , issues discussion, manage contact is usually done by emails. Iâ€™m looking to provide platform that join all this section and more, project files section where can create several beaches to update before modify the main one and find the old files by filtering, issue section with status  of the issue and ability to discuss and tag user, manager overview of work process, real-time engage with site engineer daily tasks and reports,chat rooms,budget control and analyze.

<!-- Tech stack -->

###  ProjectHub is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
